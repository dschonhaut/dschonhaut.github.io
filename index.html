    <h2><img class="profile-pic" src="/assets/images/headshot.jpg" alt="Daniel Schonhaut">I am a cognitive neuroscientist at UCSF, applying data science and machine learning to brain imaging and the study of memory and Alzheimer's disease.</a></h2>
    <p>How do our brains so effortlessly encode the events of our lives in memory? How are these memories organized and retrieved? What happens to the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, and how do disease-related changes lead to cognitive decline?</p>
    <p>My research uses advanced neuroimaging techniques and computational methods to investigate these fundamental questions about human memory in health and disease. On the neural side, I utilize intracranial EEG, high-resolution MRI, and PET imaging to probe brain structure and function. On the psychological side, I work with task-based cognitive testing data, naturalistic experiments using immersive computer games, and survey responses to assess cognition and behavior.</p>
    <p>Through collaboration with clinicians and researchers at UCSF's Memory and Aging Center, I am working to develop richer models of Alzheimer's disease progression that enable prediction at the individual patient level. Ongoing collaborations with other researchers include projects implementing neuroimaging in clinical trials and nationwide studies, and exploration of large, longitudinal datasets that connect imaging biomarkers with fluid assays, genetics, and cognitive testing.</p>
    <p>I am passionate about open science and regularly share code and analysis pipelines through this GitHub repository. Here you will find tools for neuroimaging processing and analysis pipelines, machine learning applications to physiological and neuroimaging data, and resources for reproducible research, including code repositories for published papers.</p>
