    <h1>Daniel Schonhaut, Ph.D</h1>
    <h2><img class="profile-pic" src="/assets/images/headshot.jpg" alt="Daniel Schonhaut">I am a cognitive neuroscientist at the University of California, San Francisco, applying data science and machine learning principles to brain imaging data in the study and memory and aging.</a></h2>
    <p>How do our brains so effortlessly encode the events of our lives in memory? How are these memories organized? What happens to the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease, and how do disease-related changes lead to cognitive decline?</p>
    <p>My research uses advanced neuroimaging techniques and computational methods to investigate these fundamental questions about human memory and cognition. On the neural side, I utilize intracranial EEG, high-resolution MRI, and PET imaging to probe brain structure and function. On the psychological side, task-based cognitive assessment, immersive computer games, and questionnaires are used to assess different aspects of cognition and behavior.</p>
    <p>Through collaborations with clinicians and researchers at UCSF's Memory and Aging Center, I am working to develop richer models of Alzheimer's disease progression that allow prediction at the level of individual patients. Collaborative projects touch on other aspects of neuroimaging that relate to clinical practice and links between imaging data, fluid biomarkers, and cognition.</p>
    <p>I am passionate about open science and regularly share code and analysis pipelines through this GitHub repository. Here you will find tools for neuroimaging processing and analysis pipelines, machine learning applications to physiological and neuroimaging data, and resources for reproducible research, including code repositories for published papers.</p>
